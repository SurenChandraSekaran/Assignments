# Assignments
## Assignment 1: Report
From this assignment I have learned how to conduct a comparative evaluation of websites in the AI domain using Lighthouse provided valuable insights into various aspects of web performance, accessibility, and best practice Lighthouse helped in understanding how different AI-related websites perform in terms of loading speed and responsiveness.
Key performance indicators such as First Contentful Paint (FCP), Speed Index, and Time to Interactive (TTI) highlighted the efficiency of each site. I learned how optimizing images, reducing JavaScript payloads, and leveraging browser caching can significantly enhance website performance.
In my opinion, our report could have been improved if we used more mind maps and charts. By conveying our findings through plain writing, the report is not as attractive or visually striking.

## Assignment 2: Website
From this assignment, I have had a valuable learning experience that encompasses a variety of technical skills. I learned how to structure a web page using HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and lists.
I also discovered how to style and bring my website to life by using CSS and Javascript.
In my opinion, our website could have been improved with better understanding of CSS and Javascript which would have enabled us to customize and style the website further to make it more attractive.

## Assignment 3: GitHub E-portfolio
While doing this assignment, I believe I have created a compelling introduction and summary that highlights my background, skills, and career aspirations.
From this assignment I've learned various technical and organizational skills regarding GitHub. I learned how to create and manage repositories, understand commit history, and effectively use branching and merging strategies.
I also learned principles of design, such as layout, color schemes, typography, and visual hierarchy, to create an attractive portfolio.
In my opinion, the way the E-portfolio could have been improved is the courses and certification. I wish I had joined more courses and received certifications to put in my profile to make the e-portfolio look more accomplished and professional.
